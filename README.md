# SONAR: An Adaptive Control Architecture for SOcial Norm Aware Robots
![alt text](sonar.jpg)
SONAR is a Python 3.9 resource that provides robot-agnostic decision-making mechanisms for social robots that allow them to account for social norms, practices and cues in interactions with humans.

SONAR is technically a multi-agent system with a hierarchical organization. 

At the top of the hierarchy there is one [BDI (Belief-Desires-Intention)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model) agent, which determines and handles the sense-reasoning-acting cycle of the robot following the BDI model.

Below the BDI agent in the hierarchy there are different worker agents that run in parallel, each of them performing specific autonomous tasks.

Some worker agents handle specific aspects of robotic behaviors and sensing.
For example, the vision handler worker handles aspects related to the vision of the robot.
The posture handler worker handles aspects related to the movements of the robot.
The chatter worker handles aspects related to the communication with humans.

Other worker agents perform tasks internal to the multi-agent system. For example, the data collector worker collects the most recent data from other worker agents and process them in order to create beliefs to provide to the BDI agent. The norm adapter agent regularly performs norm adaptation based on the data collected over time.

SONAR is decoupled from any specific implementation of a robot. 
Commands for and inputs from the robot (or other devices) are given and received via MQTT. [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) is a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model, and the standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things.

SONAR has been effectively used to control a [Nao robot](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/nao) by establishing MQTT communication between SONAR and the [MQTT-Nao-Interface](https://github.com/dellannadavide/MQTT-Nao-Interface).
Services from both SONAR and MQTT-Nao-Interface subscribe to or publish messages to an MQTT broker.
This allows for decoupling between the specific interface with the robot or other devices (e.g., microphones, cameras, or IoT devices) and SONAR. 

Specifically concerning the MQTT-Nao-Interface, such an interface runs, due to compatibility constraints with the NAOqi Python SDK, on Python 2.7 (not well supported anymore as of 2022). 
Decoupling such an interface from the implementation of SONAR, facilitates the implementation of several modern features that rely on libraries based on Python 3.x.


Below are reported the steps required to install and run SONAR.

## 2. Basic services required to run SONAR
### 2.1. XMPP communication server.
SONAR makes use of the Python library [SPADE](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html), which is a Multi-agent platform based on [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) (the open universal messaging standard). SPADE requires access to an XMPP communication server. 
Below, it is reported a quick tutorial on how to install [Prosody](https://prosody.im/), the SPADE recommended XMPP server, on Windows 10. 
For more details see the [SPADE quick start](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) and the [Prosody guidelines](https://prosody.im/download/start#windows).
#### 2.1.1. Install Linux on Windows with WSL (see [Microsoft guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
>1. Open Windows PowerShell with admin rights
>2. Run ``` wsl --install ```
>3. Reboot the system 
>4. Open Microsoft Store and type and get Ubuntu
>5. Follow the instruction in the Ubuntu terminal to create a new UNIX user account.
>6. Run ``` sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade```  to update packages.
#### 2.1.2. Install Prosody on Ubuntu
>1. In the Ubuntu terminal, as per step 6 of Sec 2.1.1., run ``` sudo apt install prosody ``` and type ```Y``` when requested.
>2. That's it. See Section 4.2.1. for details on how to create accounts for the SPADE agents.
#### 2.1.3. Start Prosody service
>In the Ubuntu terminal, run ``` sudo service prosody start ```

### 2.2. MQTT message broker
Below, it is reported a very quick tutorial on how to install [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), an open source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol, on the Ubuntu distro installed as per Section 2.1.1.

#### 2.2.1. Install and start Mosquitto on Ubuntu
>1. In the Ubuntu terminal, as per step 6 of Sec 2.1.1., add the mosquitto-dev PPA by running first ```sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa``` and then ```sudo apt-get update```.
>2. To install Mosquitto, run ``` sudo apt install mosquitto ``` and type ```Y``` when requested.
>3. To start Mosquitto, run ``` sudo service mosquitto start ```

## 3. Setup SONAR
### 3.1. Required software and libraries
SONAR is a python resource that runs on Python 3.9. Therefore the basic requirement is [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

SONAR makes extensive use of a variety of state-of-the-art libraries for, among others: multi-agent communication; natural language processing, understanding and generation; Fuzzy Inference, Multi-Objective optimization, Belief-Desire-Intention-based inference. 
For this reason, after having set up the Python environment, a number of Python packages need to be installed. The list of requirements can be found in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
A standard way to install all required packages is to run command ```pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```. Based on your environment you may adopt the most handy procedure.

Additionally, as per Section 2, SONAR relies on XMPP and MQTT services. Follow steps in Section 2 to install them.

>**Notes** 
> 1. [SPADE](https://pypi.org/project/spade/) depends on some packages that require the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to be installed.
> 2. [Tokenizers](https://pypi.org/project/tokenizers/) might require to install a Rust compiler. On Windows, this can be easily installed from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)
> 3. SONAR makes extensive use of pretrained language models, which will be downloaded (if not available already) at the first execution. The whole set of models might require a couple of GB of space on the hard drive.
> 4. [Spacy](https://spacy.io/usage) requires the model ```en_core_web_sm```. This can be installed by running ```python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm```.

### 3.2. Setup and Run
#### 3.2.1 Register the agents in the XMPP server
The first step required in order to allow communication between agents in SONAR is to register the agents in the XMPP server with a ```jid``` and a ```password```.
This step only needs to be done once.

Following the [guidelines from the SPADE library](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html), the jid (e.g., <agent_name>@<your_xmpp_server>) contains the agentâ€™s name (before the @) and the DNS or IP of the XMPP server (after the @). 

> **Example.** Assuming that you installed the Prosody XMPP server locally by following the steps indicated in Section 2.1, the server IP will be by default ```localhost```.
An example of <agent_name> that operates in SONAR is ```sonar_chatter```. In the default settings, therefore such an agent will have jid ```sonar_chatter@localhost```.

The list of required agents and XMPP-related information (e.g., name, server, jid, pwd) can be found at the bottom of file ```SONAR/utils/constants.py```. 
All agents in the ```XMPP_AGENTS_DETAILS``` data structure should be registered in the XMPP server.

> **Tip.** You can extend or modify such a data structure if you run the agents on a different IP, if you want to give different names to the agents in the XMPP server, or if you want to add additional agents.

To register the required SONAR agents on Prosody via terminal (see [Prosody guidelines](https://prosody.im/doc/creating_accounts) for more details):
>1. Start Prosody as per section 2.1.3
>2. Register an agent by running ```sudo prosodyctl adduser <agent_name>@<your_xmpp_server>```, and by providing the password for the agent as indicated in file ```SONAR.utils.constants.py```.
>3. Repeat step 2 for all agents indicated in ```XMPP_AGENTS_DETAILS```.
>4. Verify that all agents have been created by listing the accounts registered in Prosody by running ```sudo ls /var/lib/prosody/localhost/accounts```. The output should contain the list of registered accounts on server ```localhost```.

#### 3.2.2 Run SONAR
>1. Start Prosody as per section 2.1.3
>2. Start Mosquitto as per section 2.2.1
>3. Run SONAR via ```python SONAR/main.py```.

At this point SONAR should be running, with the several agents communicating between each other, and waiting for messages to be received via the MQTT broker by the [MQTT-Nao-Interface](https://github.com/dellannadavide/MQTT-Nao-Interface)..
